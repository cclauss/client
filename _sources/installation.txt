Installation
============

We assume that you have prepared your system (see Section
:ref:`_my-reference-label`) on which you like to install the cloudmesh
client. We recommend that you use python 2.7.10, pip 7.1.2 and use
virtualenv. Furthermore we recommend that on Linux systems you have
readline installed as it is a convenient tool for command line
manipulation. In the next sections we will walk you through a setup
that has been proven to work for developers and users and is very easy
to replicate.


Install Cloudmesh Client via pip
----------------------------------

.. warning:: at this time we recommend you use the source install and not
             the pip install, as we have not updated the code to pypi.

Users can install the cloudmesh client via pip

.. prompt:: bash

   cd ~
   pip install cloudmesh_client

Please note that the directory in which you call pip install does not have a
directory called cloudmesh_client This may prevent pip from working properly.


Cloudmesh Installation from Source
-----------------------------------

Users can also install cloudmesh from the source code located in
github. We assume that we conduct a source code install into the directory::
  
  ~/github/cloudmesh

If you like to use a different directory, that is also possible, but
the instructions we provide here assumes are targeted towards this
base directory. Please use the following commands

.. prompt:: bash

   mkdir -p github/cloudmesh
   cd github/cloudmesh
   git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/client.git
   cd client
   # make sure you have a virtualenv configured and activated
   # chose your branch and do either
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install .


.. warning:: We do not at this time support the instalation with::
	     
	       python setup.py install

             Instead we require you to use

	       pip install -U .
     
   
We have two branches in the code. The `master` branch and the `dev` branch.

The master branch provides a snapshot of the code that should work and has
passed the unit tests. If you have issues, please send us mail.

However, in some circumstances you may which to use the newest version of
cloudmesh which you can get from the `dev` branch. To get the newest version issue the command

.. prompt:: bash

   git checkout dev

before you call the command `pip install -U .`. For more information about git see the
github manual on the github.com web page.


Updating an existing source distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the development phase of cloudmesh you may need to update the
code from source. Please do not forget to update them accordingly

.. prompt:: bash
  
   export CLOUDMESH_HOME=$HOME/github/cloudmesh
   cd $CLOUDMESH_HOME/client
   git pull
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install .
