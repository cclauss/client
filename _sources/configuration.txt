.. _configuration:

Configuration
=============

During the installation of cloudmesh it will automatically generate
a configuration file in the directory:

   ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml

To complete the setup you need to call the setup command in the terminal
command prompt with

.. prompt::  bash

	     cm setup


If this file is missing, you can run the command:

.. prompt::  bash

    cm help

to automatically generate it from defaults.

The file will be a template and it can either be modified with your
favorite editor, or if you are at Indiana University and want to use the
kilo cloud you can use the command

.. prompt::  bash

    cm remote register

This will add the appropriate information into the yaml file.

However, you must make sure that the the project you have at Indiana
University is activated. A simple project request via the futuresystems.org
portal is not sufficient. THe request muct be send via e-mail to laszewski@gmail.com
by the project lead or project manager. Please note that restrictions may apply as we
will serve first the IU community.

The file will be looking as follows. You will have several options to
modify the file as explained bellow

.. literalinclude:: ../../cloudmesh_client/etc/cloudmesh.yaml

You can modify the file by hand and replace the ``TBD`` values
according to your information about your cloud. You can add new clouds
or delete the once that you do not want.

Please make sure to **not** modify the original file in the code ore the
lib at `cloudmesh_client/etc/cloudmesh.yaml`/ THe file you want to modify is located in
`$HOME/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml`


.. warning:: Just as private keys should be kept private so does
             the cloudmesh.yaml file. Please, make sure the file
             is properly protected as it contains sensitive information.


Get Registration from Indiana University
----------------------------------------

In case you have an account on http::/portal.futuresystems.org the
integration can be done automatically for you with the account
information available to you as previously explained.


The best way is to configure first your ssh client to conveniently
log into india the machine where you can find the configuration information.
To do so, please edit the following file

::

   ~/./ssh/config

and add the following lines to it

::

   Host india
       User: albert
       Hostname: india.futuresystems.org

please replace albert with your portal name that you have used for
registration with futuresystems.org. Once you have done this please
verify that you have access to india with a command such as

.. prompt::  bash

  ssh india uname -a

Next test if you have cloud access. This is easily done by doing:

  ssh india cat .cloudmesh/clouds/india/kilo/openrc.sh

IF this file does not exist you do not have access to the kilo cloud yet
and you need to get in contact with laszewski@gmail.com. Once you have
access you can proceed.

Next register the FutureSystems clouds into your cloudmesh yaml file with
the command

.. prompt::  bash

   cm register remote

This will update your cloudmesh.yaml file with the information retrieved
from india. While retrieving the information on india from the file::

  ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/india/kilo/openrc.sh

Make sure you add a valid tenant to the yaml file. More information
about using india can be found at http://portal.futuresystems.org


Registration of other clouds
-----------------------------

The register command is quite powerful and useful and we encourage you to
take a closer look at the manual pages. This includes command such as

To find out more about the registration command

.. prompt::  bash

   cm register help

To edit the yaml file with the editor defined by the Shell variable `$EDITOR`

.. prompt::  bash

   register edit

To list the `cloudmesh.yaml` file

.. prompt::  bash

   register list

Registartion of EC2 clouds with the zip file
---------------------------------------------

.. warning:: the ec2 provider is not yet operational

In case you have an openstack cloud that exports an ec2 zip file you can register
such a cloud by first downloading the zip file to your computer and than issuing
the command

.. prompt::  bash

    cm register ec2 mycloud filename.zip

where `filename.zip` is the location of the zip file and `mycloud` is the name
of the cloud that you would like to have cloudmesh use for this cloud.

You can than edit the ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml file to make further improvements
such as setting the defaults.


Registration of Cybera Cloud
-------------------------------

Cybera an organization from Canada provides an easy accessible
openstack cloud. This cloud should only be used while following their
access policies documented at:

* http://www.cybera.ca/projects/cloud-resources/rapid-access-cloud/faq/#What_is_RAC

YOu may ask for permission, if you do not fit this category. Once you
have created an account at:

* https://rac-portal.cybera.ca/

YOu can access to Openstack portal at

* https://cloud.cybera.ca/auth/login/

Just as Chameleon Cloud the Cybera cloud allows openstack rc and ec2
rc files.

Registration of Cybera Openstack Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you have an account ana a project it is simple to configure
cloudmesh to include chameleon cloud in its resource set. To do so,
edit the file:

   ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml

Edit the follwoing lines::

                OS_PASSWORD: TBD
                OS_TENANT_NAME: TBD
                OS_TENANT_ID: TBD
                OS_PROJECT_NAME: TBD
                OS_USERNAME: TBD

Let us assume you have the username `albert` and the project id
`FG-101`, Than the lines need to be changed to::

                OS_PASSWORD: <your user password>
                OS_TENANT_NAME: FG-101
                OS_TENANT_ID: FG-101
                OS_PROJECT_NAME: FG-101
                OS_USERNAME: albert


You can find this information also in the openrc.sh file which you can
download via the Openstack Horizon interface by following this link:

* https://cloud.cybera.ca/project/access_and_security/api_access/openrc/

Registration of Cybera EC2 Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cybera cloud also support the usage of the EC2 interface which
is a pit more complex to set up than the openstack configuration.
First, you have to download a configuration directory, that is
packaged as a zip file. This file can be found at

* https://cloud.cybera.ca/project/access_and_security/api_access/ec2/

Let us assume you have the username albert and
the project FG-101. Than the zip file will be called::

  FG-101-x509.zip

Let us set some environment variables to make the configuration
description easier

.. prompt:: bash

   export C_USERNAME=<your cybera username>
   export C_PROJECT=<your cybera project name>
  
Unpack the zip file and place the entire directory in the .cloudmesh
directory with. (We assume that you are in the directory where your
browser downloaded the zip file and you have uncompressed it)

.. prompt:: bash

	    mkdir ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/cybera/$C_PROJECT
	    cp $C_PROJECT ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/cybera/$C_PROJECT
	    ls ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/cybera/$C_PROJECT

The directory should include the files::

  cacert.pem
  cert.pem
  ec2rc.sh
  pk.pem

Take a look at the ec2rc.sh file

.. prompt:: bash

	    cat ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/cybera/$C_PROJECT/ec2rc.sh
	    
Now you can edit the cloudmesh yaml file at::

   ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml

locate the cybera-ec2 entry and change the TBD values with the
values you see in the ec2rc.sh file::

  EC2_ACCESS_KEY: <find the value in the ec2rc.sh file>
  EC2_SECRET_KEY: <find the value in the ec2rc.sh file>
  EC2_USER_ID: <find the value in the ec2rc.sh file>

For the following lines in the cloudmesh file, please replace the TBD
values with the cybera project ID that you use for this cloud::
  
  EC2_PRIVATE_KEY: ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/cybera/TBD/pk.pem
  EC2_CERT: ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/cybera/TBD/cert.pem
  NOVA_CERT: ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/cybera/TBD/cacert.pem
  EUCALYPTUS_CERT: ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/cybera/TBD/cacert.pem

Registration of Jetstream Openstack Cloud
--------------------------------------

.. warning:: At this time the instructions for integrating the Openstack cloud from jetstream do not yet work and
             should not be followed. They are included here as notes to remind us which steps we took.


1. We send Mail to jetstream to enable an account via iplant
2. We asked for the credentials for jetstream. It was pointed out that the TACC credentials will work
3. After trying to reset the TACC credentials and reading the XSEDE user manual we are confused as there seems to be
   not a consistant documentation how to do step 2.

Here is what we found out and did

1. We reset the password from TACC via

   * https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/password-reset/-/password/request-reset

2. We tried to use the bassword and username via while using the domains 'tacc' and 'default'

   * https://jblb.jetstream-cloud.org/dashboard/

3. We found the following doument which is not obvious to find

   * http://jetstream-cloud.org/files/Jetstream_User_Guide-3-3-16-11am-Reduced.pdf

4. In it you find the link to the iplant portal:

   * https://use.jetstream-cloud.org

   We can login to iplant and start vms through it. But it used the globus credentials which are yet under a
   different name
