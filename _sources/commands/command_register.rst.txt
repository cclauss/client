Register Command
======================================================================


Registering different clouds with the cloudmesh register command is
easy. We have a number of predefined templates that are stored in the
~/.cloudmesh .yaml file that you can use and modify. However for some
clouds such as the once at IU an easy registration exists if you have
appropriate access.

The manual page of the `register` command can be found at:
`register <../man/man.html#register>`__

.. note:: in some of our examples we will be using the user name `albert`


Quickstart for registration of some clouds
----------------------------------------------

Please only use the quickstart if you know hat you are doing, otherwise,
read the manual. We assume you have access to the specific clouds that you
like to access. On a terminal say:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
    register remote kilo
   
    
to register the FutureSystems kilo cloud

More information about the cloud can be found at

* https://portal.futuresystems.org

To register an openstack cloud for which you have an existing openrc.sh file,
you can simply source the rc file first and than use the `register
env` command:

.. prompt:: bash

    $ source openrc.sh
    $ register openrc.sh

Top obtain such an openrc.sh file you can typically use the horizon
GUI and download it via the security panel of the project. If you have
multiple project you can donwload them one by one and repeat that
process.
The command will use the defaults created by the openrc.sh file and
than integrate them into the cloudmesh.yaml file. You can arbitrarily
name the cloud/project but it must not yet have been used otherwise
you are overwriting an existing cloud. Register commands such as `list`
and `backup` will help you with the management


On chameleoncloud.org you can for example go to the horizon web interface and
download the credentials in the security panel.


Introduction
--------------

As we are managing multiple clouds with cloudmesh we need to register
them first. To make it easy for you cloudmesh reads the registered
clouds from an easy to manage yaml file. This yam file is installed by::
default into the file:

    ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml

A number of templates in that file exist that refer to commonly used
clouds. YOu can fill out the yaml file with your information, add new
clouds, or delete templates of clouds that you do not use. We have
several different types of clouds that we support. This includes
OpenStack, AWS, and Azure clouds.

.. warning:: at this time we have not integrated our AWS and Azure
	     IaaS abstractions in the new cloudmesh client. We will
	     make them available in future.

As it may be inconvenient to edit this file and look at the yaml
format, we provide several administrative commands. The command:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
  register info

::
  
  File /Users/albert/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml exists. ok.

identifies if the `cloudmesh.yaml` file exists.  The `register info`
command is very similar to the `register list` command but does not
have as many options and is introduced for convenience.


To view the contents of that file, you can cat it or use the command:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
  register cat
  
To edit the file you must have set the operating system variable
EDITOR. This is ofeten done in Linux as part of the .bashrc file or
explicitly with:

.. prompt:: bash

	    export EDITOR=emacs

Once the EDITOR is set, you can use it with the the command:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
  register edit


register list
-------------

To list the clouds that are defined in the cloudmesh.yaml file, you
can use the command:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
  register list

  
which will print a table with elementary information defined for the
clouds.:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
    register list

::
   
    Clouds specified in the configuration file ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml

    +----+---------+---------------+-----------+---------+--------+
    | id | default | cloud         | iaas      | version | active |
    +----+---------+---------------+-----------+---------+--------+
    | 0  |         | cm            | openstack | kilo    | 2      |
    | 1  | *       | kilo          | openstack | kilo    | 1      |
    | 2  |         | chameleon     | openstack | kilo    |        |
    | 3  |         | cybera-c      | openstack | kilo    |        |
    | 4  |         | cybera-e      | openstack | kilo    |        |
    | 5  |         | aws           | ec2       |         |        |
    | 6  |         | chameleon-ec2 | ec2       | ec2     |        |
    | 7  |         | azure         | azure     |         |        |
    +----+---------+---------------+-----------+---------+--------+

See also: `register info`.

register ssh
------------

As we also have to sometimes login to some remote hosts it is
convenient to reuse the ssh command for that. ssh has the advantage of
being able to use a config file in $HOME/.ssh/config. MOre information
about ssh config files and their format can be found in the many web
pages if you google for `ssh config`. In case you have defined a host
`india` in ~/.ssh/config in the following way::

    Host india
        Hostname india.futuresystems.org
        User yourusername

The list command followed by ssh will give  you a list of hosts defined
in that file:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
    register list ssh

::
    
    india


register remote
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you already use an openstack cloud you may have come across an
openrc.sh file. We are providing some very special helper functions, like
for example obtain the openrc files from the FutureSystems
cloud.

The command:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
  register remote
  
will copy and register a machine on which an openrc.sh file is located
into the `cloudmesh.yaml` file. With cloudmesh we provide some default
host, thus they are very easy to configure. This includes `kilo` our
current clouds in our lab.

These commands will only work if you have an account on this
`india` and it is integrated into the ssh config file as discussed
previously.

register export
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To view the data associated with a particular cloud you can just use the
command export:

    $cm register export kilo --format=table

Which will look like this::

    +-----------------------+------------------------------------------+
    | Attribute             | Value                                    |
    +-----------------------+------------------------------------------+
    | OS_PASSWORD           | ********                                 |
    | OS_VOLUME_API_VERSION | 2                                        |
    | OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION  | 2                                        |
    | OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID  | default                                  |
    | OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID     | default                                  |
    | OS_TENANT_NAME        | fg1234                                   |
    | OS_PROJECT_NAME       | fg1234                                   |
    | OS_USERNAME           | albert                                   |
    | OS_AUTH_URL           | https://kilo.futuresystems.org:5000/v3   |
    | OS_VERSION            | kilo                                     |
    | OS_OPENRC             | ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/india/kilo/openrc.sh |
    +-----------------------+------------------------------------------+

.. warning:: ERROR

The default view returns a openrc.sh file:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
   register export kilo
   
The output contains an rc file example::

    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=default
    export OS_USERNAME=albert
    export OS_OPENRC=~/.cloudmesh/clouds/india/kilo/openrc.sh
    export OS_AUTH_URL=https://kilo.futuresystems.org:5000/v3
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=1234
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID=default
    export OS_VERSION=kilo
    export OS_VOLUME_API_VERSION=2
    export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    export OS_PASSWORD=********
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=fg1234


The passwords will be masked with eight stars: `********`.
In case you like also to see the password you can use the `--password` flag.

    register merge 
    ----------------

    .. todo:: the description of what this is doing was ambigous, we need
	      to clarify if it only replaces to do or actually add things
	      that do not exist, or just overwrites.

    In case you have already a yaml file, form another project
    you can merge two of them into the same cloudmesh yaml file. You
    simply have to specify the location of the file that you like to merge
    into the existing yaml file. However, please be careful, as it will
    overwrite the contents in ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml

    .. warning:: the description of what this is doing was ambigous, we need
	  to clarify if it only replaces to do or actually add things
	  that do not exist, or just overwrites.
	  
    .. warning:: We used to have a .bak.# when we modified the yaml file, do
	  you still have this

    Hence the command 

    .. prompt:: bash, cm>

	register merge my_cloudmesh.yaml

    This command allows the content from another yaml file to be merged into the
    regular cloudmesh.yaml file. A backup of the old cloudmesh.yaml file is
    created with an increased number.

    .. note: The merge command is not tested



register CLOUD
---------------

In some cases it is nice to have an interactive mechanism to fill out
the missing yaml file information that is indicated with TBD. This is
useful, if you do not have an editor at hand. Thus you can use the
command:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
  register CLOUD
  
where cloud is the name of the cloud. Default names for the clouds can
be found with the `register list` command.

The `register CLOUD` command will interactively ask for the values and
add them into your yaml file:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
    register kilo

::
   
    Please enter email[TBD]:
    Editing the credentials for cloud kilo
    Please enter OS_TENANT_NAME[TBD]:
    ...


.. comment::
   
    register check
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    To find any not filled out values, you can use the command:

    .. prompt:: bash, cm>

      register check


    which hecks the yaml file for completness and list all fields that
    have the value TBD:

    .. prompt:: bash, cm>

	register check

    ::

	  ERROR: The file has 11 values to be fixed

	  email: TBD
	  username: TBD
	  flavor: TBD
	  EC2_ACCESS_KEY: TBD
	  EC2_SECRET_KEY: TBD
	  keyname: TBD
	  userid: TBD
	  managementcertfile: TBD
	  servicecertfile: TBD
	  subscriptionid: TBD
	  thumbprint: TBD

register json HOST
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of using the cat command and listing the contents of a cloud
registration in yaml format you can also explicitly obtain a jason
representation by issueing the command:

  $ register json

It will return output in json format:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>
	    
    register json azure

::
   
   {
        "cm_heading": "Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines",
        "cm_label": "waz",
        "cm_host": "windowsazure.com",
        "default": {
            "flavor": "ExtraSmall",
            "image": "b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_2-LTS-amd64-server-20150610-en-us-30GB",
            "location": "East US"
        },
        "credentials": {
            "managementcertfile": "TBD",
            "servicecertfile": "TBD",
            "subscriptionid": "TBD",
            "thumbprint": "TBD"
        },
        "cm_type": "azure",
        "cm_type_version": null
    }


    
register profile
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of modifying the profile username in the cloudmesh yaml file
manually, this command provides a convenient way of setting the
username through cm shell:

.. prompt:: bash, cm>

   register profile

::

   # ######################################################################
   # Register profile
   # ######################################################################
   Enter firstname (TBD): Gregor
   Enter lastname (TBD): von Laszewski    
   Enter email (TBD): laszewski@gmail.com
   Enter user (TBD): gregor
