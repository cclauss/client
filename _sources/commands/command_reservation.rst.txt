Reservation Command
======================================================================

.. warning:: This command is experimental and is not yet fully
             integrated. It only stores reservations, but does not act
             upon them.

One of the features of cloudmesh is to build a mesh of resources and
services. In some cases we which to reserve resources that allow
reservations. However we also may want to use a resource till a
particular time frame and release it. For this cases it is practical
to provide the concept of a reservation. A simple reservation is named
and contains a start and end point. We currently store named virtual
machines into a reservation for named clouds. Reservations are similar
to groups just that they have a time frame associated with them. A
timeless reservation is like a group.

The manual page of the `reservation` command can be found at: `reservation
<../man/man.html#reservation>`__
