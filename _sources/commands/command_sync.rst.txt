Sync Command
======================================================================

The sync command provides an API that allows users to synchronise
a local directory with a directory on any remote machine on the cloud.
The sync command can be used to pull in data from the remote host, or
send data from local machine to remote host.

The manual page of the network command can be
found at: `sync <../man/man.html#sync>`__

.. warning:: is this supposed to be syncing with all VMs in the
    current target cloud? In my test it was trying to copy to
    chameleoncloud.org when I set cm as the default cloud.
